    This function optimizes w and b by running a gradient descent algorithm

    Arguments:
    w -- weights, a numpy array of size (number of features, 1)
    b -- bias, a scalar
    X -- data of shape (number of features, number of examples)
    Y -- results of shape (1, number of examples)
    num_iterations -- number of iterations of the optimization loop
    learning_rate -- learning rate of the gradient descent update rule
    print_cost -- True to print the loss every 100 steps

    Returns:
    params -- dictionary containing the weights w and bias b
    grads -- dictionary containing the gradients of the weights and bias with respect to the cost function
    costs -- list of all the costs computed during the optimization, this will be used to plot the learning curve.
