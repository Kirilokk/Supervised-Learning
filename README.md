# Hi. this is my study statistic algorithms i've implemented while DataRoot course:

+ **Lineral regression with one variable**
+ Lineral regression with multiple variables
+ Logistic regression
+ Polynomial Ridge Regression

## Linear regression is used for finding linear relationship between target and one or more predictors.
## In this case, it is used to predict kangaroo nasal width *having* its *length*.
