# Hi, this is my study statistic algorithms i've implemented while DataRoot course(Supervised learning):

+ **Lineral regression with one variable**;
+ Lineral regression with multiple variables;
+ Logistic regression;
+ Polynomial Ridge Regression;



## Linear regression is used for finding linear relationship between target and one or more predictors. In this example, it is used to predict kangaroo nasal width *having* its *length*.
